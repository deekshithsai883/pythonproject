Report: Football Match Outcome Prediction Model

Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of football matches (e.g., win, loss, or draw). By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble models, we derive meaningful insights from a dataset of historical football match statistics. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment via a Flask API.

1. Data Preparation

Tasks Completed:

Dataset was analyzed for missing values and scaled for consistency.

Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets using train_test_split.

Feature scaling was applied using StandardScaler to normalize numerical data.


Verification:

Data was correctly scaled (mean ~0, standard deviation ~1).

Train-test split ensured proper separation of data for evaluation.

2. Baseline Model: Random Forest

Tasks Completed:

A baseline Random Forest Classifier was trained on the scaled data.

Key performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) were calculated.


Results:

The model achieved moderate accuracy with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Provided feature importance insights into which match statistics contributed most to predictions.


Verification:

Training and testing accuracies were checked to ensure no overfitting.

Confusion matrix and classification report were analyzed to validate predictions.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning

Tasks Completed:

GridSearchCV was used to optimize hyperparameters for Random Forest.

Parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split were fine-tuned.


Results:

Optimal parameters were identified, improving model accuracy and reducing overfitting.


Verification:

Cross-validation scores and best parameters were logged.

The tuned model outperformed the baseline in accuracy and overall performance.

4. Alternative Model: XGBoost

Tasks Completed:

XGBoost Classifier was trained as an alternative to Random Forest.

Performance metrics were computed and compared with the Random Forest model.


Results:

XGBoost outperformed Random Forest in terms of accuracy and generalization.

Faster training times and better handling of data imbalance.


Verification:

Accuracy scores for XGBoost on both train and test datasets were higher than Random Forest.

Confusion matrix confirmed improved prediction for all classes (win, loss, draw).



---

5. Ensemble Model

Tasks Completed:

Combined Random Forest and XGBoost using a Voting Classifier for ensemble learning.

Voting strategy (soft voting) was used to improve overall performance.


Results:

Ensemble model delivered the best performance among all models.

Benefited from leveraging strengths of both algorithms.


Verification:

Cross-validation scores and classification reports confirmed improved results.

Ensemble accuracy exceeded individual model accuracies.



---

6. Feature Importance

Tasks Completed:

Visualized feature importance from the best-performing model.

Top 10 most important features contributing to predictions were identified.


Results:

Features like goals, shots, possession, and fouls were most influential in predicting outcomes.

Feature importance analysis provided actionable insights for sports analysts.


Verification:

Feature importance scores were consistent with domain knowledge of football match outcomes.

7. Model Deployment

Tasks Completed:

Best model was saved as a .pkl file using joblib.

Flask API was developed to expose the model for real-time predictions.


Results:

API accepts match statistics and predicts match outcomes (win, loss, or draw).

Successfully integrated machine learning with a web-based interface for usability.


Verification:

Flask API was tested using Postman and cURL commands.

Predictions returned by the API matched model outputs during testing.



---

8. Model Validation

Tasks Completed:
Model accuracy was compared to a baseline (Dummy Classifier predicting the most frequent class).

Cross-validation ensured robustness and generalizability of the model.


Results:

Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble models significantly outperformed the baseline.

Cross-validation scores showed consistent performance across folds.


Verification:

Confusion matrix, classification report, and cross-validation metrics confirmed reliability.

Ensemble model delivered the highest accuracy and generalization.
